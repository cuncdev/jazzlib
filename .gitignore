ðŸ‘½ A good gitignore for Next.js

Nov 08, 2019

There are a few common files that should be ignored for every Next.js project. We give a recommended configuration for working with git in Next.js projects
What should you gitignore with Next.js

While developing locally Next.js will generate a directory

.next/

which contains the files that get served to your browser. This set of files will also be generated at built time (with more optimizations). Since the

next build

step should occur in your continuous integration (CI) pipeline you donâ€™t need to commit them to source control.

As Next.js is based on Node.js youâ€™ll also need to ignore the

node_modules/

directory. Some other common things to ignore are

.env

files, so you donâ€™t leak secrets into source control.
What should you not gitignore with Next.js

You definitely do not want to ignore a few things in the project. Firstly do not ignore the lock file (eg

yarn.lock

or

npm-lock.json

). These are important for having consistently installed dependencies.

If you are using Typescript with Next.js you also want to be sure not to ignore the

tsconfig.json

file that Next.js will automatically generate for you since that will be needed to reliably compile the Typescript application back down to Javascript.
Sample gitignore

.next
# dotenv environment variables file (build for Zeit Now)
.env
.env.build
# Dependency directories
node_modules/
# Logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
